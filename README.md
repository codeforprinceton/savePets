# savePets
SAVE Animals Repository

# Goals

Three Montgomery Upper Middle School students are working on an app for SAVE (an animal shelter) to provide the following capabilities -
* Allow potential adopters to view pet inventory and contact SAVE if interested
* Allow people to see what donations SAVE needs
* Allow potential volunteers to sign-up

# Backlog

* Currently, pet inventory is packaged with the app as a local file - we need to connect the app to a remote data base/file
* Build out volunteer page and email capability
* Build out donate page and connect it to a remote data base/file
* Data entry screens to allow SAVE to manage pet inventory
* Data entry screen to allow SAVE to change what donations they require

# Development Platform

* AppceleratorStudio 4.0 download at https://web.appcelerator.com/product/studio
* Languages used: JavaScript, XML

# Development Process

* Clone the repository
* Fire up AppceleratorStudio
* File->Import
* Choose Appcelerator/Existing Mobile Project
* Browse to and select the cloned folder (savePets)
* Finish


savePets should now show up under the Project Explorer on the left of AppceleratorStudio's IDE. You can now work on the files under the app folder.

# Code Organization
* All application code is under the 'app' folder
* All data that is currently locally packaged with the app is in JSON form under 'app/alloy.js'
